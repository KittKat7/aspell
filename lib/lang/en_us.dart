## Intro
Welcome to the help page for the spelling aspect of this app. This page was very heavily inspired by the webpage [asl.ms](https://asl.ms) by Dr. Bill Vicars. (You should definitally go check it out!!!) And the concept of the spelling page here is very similer.
## How To Use
There are two different designed uses for this page,
### 1) Comprehension Practice
This mode is very similer to what is available on [asl.ms](https://asl.ms) The designed use is to help you improve your skills at reading finger spelling. In this mode, you will shown a fingerspelled word. If you think you know what the word is, you can enter your guess into the text box and press confirm. The text under the Sign Box will tell you whether your guess was correct or incorrect. If you want to see the current word again, you can press 'Sign Again', if you want a new word, press 'New Word'. If you want to change the speed at which the signs are shown, use the slider. The speed is measured in letters per second.
### 2) Signing Practice
This mode allows you to see how a word would be spelled in sign language (Note: a lot of asl words have an actual, not spelled, sign. I encourage you to look it up, and to use this tool more for practicing spelling in general). Enter the word or sentence you want to see finger spelled in the text box, and press 'Sign This'. The finger spelling will then be displayed. If you want to change the speed of the signing, use the slider to do so. Signing speed is measured in letters per second.

## User Interface Components
- **Sign Box:** The first and most obvious is the sign box. The sign box is where the signs will appear. 
- **Info Text:** The text under the sign box shows you the singing speed, measures in letters per second. The info text also shows you how many words you have read correctly, and whether your last guess was correct or incorrect.
- **Speed Control:** The speed control slider allows you to change how many letters are signed per second.
- **Text Entry:** The text entry box is where you will enter what you want to see spelled, and also where you will enter your guess as to what the current word is.
- **Confirm Button:** The confirm button confirms your guess at to what the current word is.
- **New Word Button:** If you want to start guessing the words, or are stuck on one and want something new, the 'New Word' button will generate a new current word.
- **Sign Again Button:**
This will replay the spelling for the current word.
- **Sign This Button:** This will show you how to sign the spelling for the word currently in the text box.

## **What is ASpeLl?**

ASpeLl is an app designed to help new Americal Sign Language (ASL) signers practice their signing and comprehension of the alphabet/finger spelling and help them learn some very basic signs. This app is **NOT** designed to be a replacement for an ASL class. ASL classes contain a lot of very useful information (A lot more signs, signing etiquette and grammar, information about deaf culture, etc) and you are highly encouraged to take an ASL class. This app is designed to be a practice resource to help improve (mostly finger spelling) skills.

## **Background**

Avery is a college student at Appalachian State University studying a major in computer science and a minor in American Sign Language. Avery, when encountered with a problem, often attempts to make a computer program to help solve the problem. In this case, the problem is they haven't done any signing in at least a year, and they are enrolled in an ASL 3 class. To practice their signing they turned to sites like [asl.ms](https://asl.ms) This site is an amazing resource but is not optimized to work well on a mobile device. This got annoying to Avery, so they set out to make their own version, hence, ASpeLl.

## **How is this project done?**

This is an open-source project, go check out the code! You can check out the source code at (https://github.com/KittKat7/ASpeLl) or the current webapp code at (https://github.com/KittKat7/ASpeLl-app). This app is programmed in the flutter framework (using dart as its language). The reason for flutter was to write the source code only once and have it be able to run on most common devices, IE: Windows, Linux, MacOS, Android, IOS, and Web.
